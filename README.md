# KodMarkdown

__Author:__ [Yasin Torun](https://github.com/yasintorun)


### Description
KodMarkdown converts text in markdown format to html element.
KodMarkdown is powered by the `react-markdown` package.
It visualizes the codes with the `react-syntax-highlighter` package.


### Motivation
Many markdown content is hosted on the KodChallenge platform. The `react-markdown` package provides a generic template. We made it our own custom component and used this component in some places. But the kodchallenge project consists of many projects. We have to build and maintain individual components for each project. In order to prevent this, the `kod-markdown` package was developed. In this way, its maintenance and development was provided from a single place. It is also designed in a flexible structure.
